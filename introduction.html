			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<h3>Project Overview and Aims </h3>
			<p>This project offers a race-centered digital reading of Emily Brontë’s <em>Wuthering
					Heights</em> (1847) through customized Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) markup. By
				encoding racialized language surrounding Heathcliff, the project makes visible
				patterns of description, exclusion, and ambiguity that have long fueled critical
				conversations about the novel. Through this encoding users can witness the
				racialized language within the larger context of the novel and think more critically
				about the choices Brontë made by creating an important character such as Heathcliff.
				Rather than treating race as a secondary or speculative concern, this project
				positions racialization as a structuring force within the text and asks what new
				insights emerge when digital methods are designed explicitly to account for it. This
				project demonstrates how encoding can function not merely as a tool for textual
				organization, but as a critical practice capable of exposing how language produces
				racial meaning. Through this process of encoding I managed to create a custom TEI
				schema which allowed me to closely define the language of the text through creating
				specific categories. These markings when examined side by side allow for user to
				experience the racial language in a completely different way, rather than just
				reading through the text to see these examples by utilizing TEI I was able to
				explicitly mark these findings to allow for further analysis and showcase how we can
				use TEI to mark these concepts. My hope with this schema is to use this as a model
				to replicate amongst other texts so I can showcase the significance of marking this
				racialized language and how this can provide important insights. </p>
			<h3>Critical Background and Purpose</h3>
			<p>Emily Brontë’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (1847) is a Gothic novel set on the
				Yorkshire moors. The novel itself is told through two different narrators, Nelly and
				Lockwood. The story centers on Heathcliff, a foundling of unknown origin brought
				into the Earnshaw household, whose presence reshapes the lives of those around him.
				He is constantly ridiculed, bullied, and never truly accepted into the family. He is
				raised alongside Catherine Earnshaw, their daughter. Heathcliff forms an intense
				bond with her that is ultimately fractured and the two share a toxic relationship
				that haunts the other characters of the book. After Catherine marries Edgar Linton,
				Heathcliff disappears, only to return years later wealthy and determined to reclaim
				power over both families. His pursuit of revenge drives the novel’s violence,
				obsession, and generational conflict, extending beyond the first generation to later
				entangle their children. </p>
			<p>Heathcliff’s identity remains deliberately unstable: he is repeatedly described
				through language associated with foreignness, darkness, and animality, yet never
				assigned a fixed racial or national origin. This ambiguity has made Heathcliff one
				of the most contested figures in nineteenth-century British fiction, raising
				questions about race, belonging, and inheritance. <em>Wuthering Heights</em>
				challenges readers through its refusal to domesticate difference, presenting a world
				in which love, cruelty, and social power are inseparable. </p>
			<p>By making these moments visible within the text itself, the project encourages
				readers to reconsider how race operates in <em>Wuthering Heights</em>—not as a
				secondary theme, but as a shaping force within its characters, narrative structure,
				and emotional economy. The text itself offers a rich analysis when it comes to our
				understanding of race within the nineteenth century and pushes back against a
				surface level reading of the text that doesn’t emphasize the significance of race. </p>
			<h3>What Does the Encoding Say? </h3>
			<p>This project shows that racialized language in <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is not
				isolated or incidental, but patterned, cumulative, and structurally embedded in the
				novel. Brontë explicitly inputs clues throughout the novel for audiences to uncover
				and wants to showcase the complexity of Heathcliff’s character. Through customized
				TEI encoding, I identified recurring moments in which Heathcliff is described using
				language that marks him as racially and socially “Other.” When viewed across the
				full text, these moments form clear patterns that are difficult to perceive through
				close reading alone but rather the encoding allows for even the less obvious moments
				of racialized language to be highlighted. Those who have read the novel might know
				the main passages that people reference that use explicit racial language but
				through my encoding I was able to capture those passages alongside other ones to
				showcase a wider picture within the entire novel. </p>
			<p>The encoding reveals that racialization operates in both explicit and implied ways.
				Direct descriptors of appearance coexist with indirect cues such as animal imagery,
				moral judgment, and social exclusion. These three categories help to frame the
				language around Heathcliff and allow for audiences to see how he becomes attached to
				specific language that is meant to taint his character and craft a villain. The
				project demonstrates that Heathcliff’s identity is shaped less by a single label
				than by the accumulation of these descriptors over time and across narrators. The
				findings also highlight the importance of historical context in understanding how
				racial meaning is constructed. References to places such as Liverpool, when encoded
				alongside racialized descriptions, reinforce the novel’s connection to Britain’s
				imperial and slave-trading history which Brontë’s father was involved in, therefore
				she would have been deeply aware of these events. Encoding these references makes
				visible how geography, history, and character description work together to racialize
				Heathcliff without ever naming his origins directly. </p>
			<p>By customizing the schema to distinguish between explicit and implied racial
				descriptors and to mark historical context, the project shows how digital tools can
				be designed to support interpretive questions about race. These findings suggest
				that race-centered encoding offers a powerful framework for reexamining
				nineteenth-century texts. </p>
			<h3>Heathcliff’s Racial Identity and the Evidence of Encoding </h3>
			<p>Heathcliff’s identity is shaped throughout <em>Wuthering Heights</em> by description
				rather than explanation, unfolding through the ways characters observe, name, and
				respond to him over time. The novel offers no single account of who Heathcliff is or
				where he comes from, but instead presents a series of moments that invite readers to
				notice how difference is expressed and understood. Here we will explore two examples
				of my TEI encoding to examine how those moments appear across the text, focusing on
				the language that contributes to Heathcliff’s racial ambiguity through an explicit
				and implicit example. By looking at these patterns together, the project offers a
				clearer view of how identity is constructed through repetition, context, and
				narrative perspective. I encourage you all to continue looking at these descriptions
				by clicking through the individual chapters linked to see the exact words used. </p>
			<p><em>Explicit: </em>“He is a <strong>“tc:racedesc type=”explicit”
				</strong>dark-skinned gipsy <strong>“/tc:racedesc” </strong> in aspect.” </p>
			<p>In this example, the narrator uses a direct racial descriptor to mark Heathcliff’s
				appearance. This is a passage people bring up when looking at Heathcliff’s race. The
				phrase “dark-skinned gipsy” functions as an explicit label that racializes
				Heathcliff through both physical description and ethnic association, drawing on
				nineteenth-century stereotypes that link darkness with foreignness and social
				marginality. Even though Brontë uses this explicit term I would still argue we
				cannot be definitively sure what specific racial group Heathcliff belongs to since
				there are other clues within the text that could be used to describe other
				marginalized people during that time. But this example is important because it
				becomes a clear indication that Heathcliff differs greatly from the other people of
				the house. </p>
			<p><em>Implied: </em>A perfect <strong>“tc:racedesc type=”implied”
				</strong>misanthropist’s Heaven<strong>“/tc:racedesc” </strong> —and Mr. Heathcliff
				and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.” </p>
			<p>This example showcases a more implicit example of racialized language. Instead of
				directly naming race or appearance, the term “misanthropist’s Heaven” suggests
				social and emotional isolation that can be read as tied to Heathcliff’s outsider
				status. The language implies a kind of otherness through characterization and mood
				rather than explicit racial labeling, reflecting how the novel often conveys racial
				meaning through atmosphere, behavior, and social exclusion rather than
				straightforward description. This subtlety allows the narrative to maintain
				Heathcliff’s ambiguous identity while still signaling difference to the reader. By
				capturing these implied references, the project reveals how racialization operates
				not only through direct statements but also through tone and implication throughout
				the novel especially when it is examined on a larger scale by looking at all the
				examples within the text. </p>
			<h3>Colonialism, Class, and Nineteenth-Century Context </h3>

			<h3>Adaptation, Erasure, and Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (2026)</h3>
			<p><em>Wuthering Heights</em> has received plenty of adaptations both on screen and in
				literature. The concept of taking a beloved classic novel and repurposing it is not
				new but when it comes to <em>Wuthering Heights</em> these adaptations fail to
				explore key themes that make Brontë’s work so important. Her focus on class, gender,
				and race are what makes the novel so valuable as a commentary of her time period.
				There has only been one film adaptation that has been made where Heathcliff is a non
				white character, the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1181614/">2011
					version.</a>
			</p>
			<p>Recently, there have been ongoing debates particularly on social media platforms such
				as TikTok as a new version of the film will be released in February 2026 by
				filmmaker Emerald Fennell. Through the promotional content released about the film
				there have been many changes made that have stripped key parts of the original
				novel. Now, there are always debates when it comes to adaptation because there are
				those who believe a novel should be adapted fully faithfully with no changes. While
				others believe you can have more loose adaptations that keep the essence of the
				original work but provide something new. I enjoy many types of adaptations and I
				don’t need to always have a frame for frame film. Sometimes it is good to see
				something different. </p>
			<p>However, the issue with the 2026 version is that we are expected to believe this is a
				true adaptation. Heathcliff, played by Jacob Elordi, a white man, now completely
				erases a key aspect of his identity that plays a pivotal part in the purpose of this
				novel. His casting choice foreclosed the novel’s persistent refusal to name
				Heathcliff’s origins while simultaneously ignoring the racialized language that
				repeatedly marks him as Other within the text. By presenting whiteness as a neutral
				default, the adaptation reframes ambiguity as absence rather than tension,
				flattening the historical, colonial, and racial contexts that shape Heathcliff’s
				social position. In doing so, the film risks reinscribing a long-standing tendency
				to separate <em>Wuthering Heights</em> from the imperial histories embedded in its
				language. </p>
			<h3>Conclusion and Hopes </h3>
			<p>This project shows how combining close reading with customized TEI encoding can
				deepen our understanding of how race operates within <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. By
				making patterns of racialized language visible across the novel, the project
				demonstrates that Heathcliff’s ambiguity is not the absence of racial meaning but
				the result of its careful construction through description, narrative voice, and
				historical context. I hope this work encourages readers to return to the novel with
				renewed attention to the language that shapes Heathcliff’s identity and to the
				imperial histories embedded in the text. </p>
			<p>By making both the encoded text and the custom schema publicly accessible, the
				project invites further scholarly engagement, classroom use, and methodological
				adaptation. Ultimately, it argues for a digital humanities practice that does not
				merely accommodate race as data, but builds race into the structure of analysis
				itself, offering a model for future work in nineteenth-century studies and beyond.
