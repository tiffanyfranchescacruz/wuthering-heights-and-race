			<h1>About</h1>
			<img src="IMG_1419.JPG" />
			<p> I am New York City native, with a Master’s in English Literature from Mills
				College at Northeastern University. I am currently a PhD student at Northeastern
				University getting my degree in English Literature. I also am a member of the
				United Confederation of Taino People. </p>
			<p>I focus on race in British literature during the long eighteenth and nineteenth
				century. I also explore race in contemporary texts that adapt classic works,
				examining why there is such a strong interest in creating historical novels with
				these protagonist, and the significance of highlighting these people within these
				novels.</p>
			<p>I am particularly interested in the constructions of genre and how they shape both
				classical and modern texts, especially in relation to notions of race. This
				fascination extends to how literature influences societal values. This showcases the
				importance of these perspectives, and their contribution to literature during this
				historical period.</p>
			<p> I focus on Gothic narratives for the way they probe moral and psychological
				complexity. My interest in Aristotelian ethics shapes my fascination with how
				literature represents virtue, morality, and the formation of character under
				conditions of fear, secrecy, and the uncanny. This interest directly informs this
				TEI project on Wuthering Heights, where I encode and analyze racialized language
				surrounding the character of Heathcliff to examine how ambiguity, otherness, and
				ethical questions operate within the novel’s Gothic framework. Through my work, I
				explore how Gothic literature sharpens readers’ moral imagination and illuminates
				the ethical dilemmas embedded within its narratives. </p>
