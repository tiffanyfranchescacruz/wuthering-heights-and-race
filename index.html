	</head>
	<body>
		<p>A TEI-based analysis of Emily Brontë’s novel, Wuthering Heights that identifies and
			interprets the racialized language surrounding Heathcliff through customized markup and
			close reading. This project intervenes in existing digital humanities methodologies by
			proposing a race-centered TEI customization model of encoding literary texts.</p>
		<p>Research Question: How can TEI encoding be customized to identify and interpret
			racialized language in Wuthering Heights, specifically in relation to Heathcliff’s
			ambiguous identity?</p>
