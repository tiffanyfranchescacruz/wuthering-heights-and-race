			<h1>Methodology</h1>
			<h3>Background:</h3>
			<p>This project combines textual encoding and thematic analysis to examine racialized
				language in <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (1847), specifically the representation of
				Heathcliff. I initially planned to study <em>Wuthering Heights</em> alongside
				several adaptations, focusing on how racial language shifts across adaptations and
				compare those differences to the original version. However, I found that working
				across three texts made it difficult to develop the depth of analysis I wanted and
				it would require a more complex customization that could be used across the novels.
				Therefore, I narrowed the project to focusing on <em>Wuthering Heights</em> alone.
				This allowed me to closely examine its racialized language and create a more
				customized, TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)-driven framework for examining
				Heathcliff’s depiction.</p>
			<h3>Text Preparation:</h3>
			<p>The project uses the 1847 edition of <a
					href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/768/768-h/768-h.htm"><em>Wuthering
						Heights</em></a>, with special attention to language shaping Heathcliff’s
				racial ambiguity. I begin by preparing a clean digital text from a public-domain
				edition available on project Gutenberg. I deleted any extra pieces that weren’t a
				part of the story from the online version which allowed me to isolate the novel into
				each chapter which I was then able to copy into Oxygen—the software I used to
				complete my encoding. </p>
			<h3>TEI Encoding: </h3>
			<p>I began with the <strong>"seg"</strong> element as an initial tool to highlight and
				isolate racialized language throughout the text. Racialized language refers to
				words, descriptions, or labels that assign social meaning to race and shape how
				certain groups are perceived or treated, and in <em>Wuthering Heights</em> this matters for
				Heathcliff because the ambiguous, often derogatory terms used to describe him
				construct him as racially Other and influence how characters interpret his identity,
				status, and place within the household and community. </p>
			<p>Through these initial exploratory markings, I noticed that patterns were more
				consistent and analytically rich when focusing specifically on Heathcliff’s
				descriptions. Through these markings I could see how different characters described
				him and it became clear that creating a custom code would allow me to express these
				patterns. I conducted repeated close readings to observe connections between
				descriptive language, narrative voice, and the historical context. By combining this
				with the TEI it allowed for the project to become a way of making patterns of
				racialized description visible, comparable, and analyzable beyond traditional close
				reading. </p>
			<p>I created an ODD file—a special XML file used to define and customize TEI
				schemas—which allowed for me to have a custom schema that I could add to and input
				my custom elements inside along with descriptions of them. The two custom tags I
				created are: </p>
			<p>
				<strong>"raceDesc"</strong> with <strong>type=”explicit”</strong> or
					<strong>type=”implied”</strong> to distinguish direct vs. indirect racial
				descriptors. Explicit descriptors refer to direct racial labels or comments stated
				openly in the text, while implied descriptors rely on indirect hints—such as
				appearance, behavior, or social treatment—that suggest racial meaning without naming
				it outright. </p>
			<p><em>Example 1:</em> “He is a <strong>“tc:racedesc
				type=”explicit”</strong>dark-skinned gipsy <strong>”tc:racedesc”</strong> in
				aspect.”  </p>
			<p>
				<em>Example 2:</em> “A perfect <strong>“tc:racedesc
				type=”implied”</strong>misanthropist’s <strong>tc:racedesc”</strong> Heaven—and Mr.
				Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.”</p>
			<p>
				<strong>“raceContext”</strong> with <strong>type=”historical”</strong> to indicate
				the contextual frame for the racialization. Historical context includes ideas and
				events related to race and history from the past.  </p>
			<p>
				<em> Example 1:</em> The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half
				dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale
				of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the streets of
					<strong>“tc:racecontext
					type=”historical”</strong>Liverpool<strong>”tc:racecontext”</strong>, where he
				picked it up and inquired for its owner.”</p>
			<p>The encoded text section consists of multiple drop down pages users can navigate
				through. The entire encoded text has been uploaded to allow for users to view the
				entirety in one space. In the chapter breakdowns these include the sections I have
				encoded using my custom code. My hope is this will allow users to view the specific
				language I wanted to highlight and this can also be a great way to focus on the
				chapters within the larger context of the novel. </p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>This combination of close reading and customized TEI encoding allows for a nuanced
				exploration of the novel’s racialized language, revealing patterns that traditional
				analysis might overlook.Through exploring the novel as a whole users can witness the
				patterns within the text and also I hope they can come away with new revelations
				that allow for deep engagement with Heathcliff’s character. By situating these
				findings within historical and social contexts, the project offers a new digital
				framework to engage with Heathcliff’s complex identity. The resulting encoded text
				and schema are publicly accessible, designed to support further scholarship,
				teaching, and critical discussion around race in nineteenth-century literature.</p>
